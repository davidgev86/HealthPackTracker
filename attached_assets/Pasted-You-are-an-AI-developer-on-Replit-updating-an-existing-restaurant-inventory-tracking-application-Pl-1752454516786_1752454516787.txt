You are an AI developer on Replit updating an existing restaurant inventory-tracking application. Please implement the following feature set—do not suggest specific frameworks or tech stacks, only focus on functionality, data models, and user flows:

1. **Inventory Sorting & Filtering**
   - Add “Category” as a first-class filter/sort field.
   - Add a “Low Stock” button that, when clicked, filters to show only items whose current quantity ≤ low-stock threshold.
   
2. **Shopping List PDF**
   - Add a “Generate Shopping List” action that collects all low-stock items and produces a downloadable PDF with item names, quantities needed, and vendor info.

3. **Vendor Management**
   - Create a “Vendors” section (pre-seeded with Sams Club, Costco, Restaurant Depot, Webrestaurant, Keany Produce, H-mart).
   - Allow each inventory item to be assigned to one or more vendors.
   - Enable filtering/sorting inventory by vendor.

4. **Extended Categories**
   - Add these new category options to the master list:
     - Frozen Bulk Items  
     - Frozen Beef Meals  
     - Frozen Chicken Meals  
     - Frozen Turkey Meals  
     - Frozen Seafood

5. **Meal-Planner Integration**
   - When the user clicks “Low Stock,” offer an optional “Plan Meals” view:
     - Display a list of meals (predefined or user-defined recipes) that use low-stock ingredients.
     - For each meal, calculate total lbs of meat required based on recipe yields and current stock.
     - Allow exporting this meal plan summary as a PDF or CSV.

6. **UI/UX Notes**
   - Each filter or action (Category, Low Stock, Vendor) should be a clear button or dropdown.
   - Place the “Generate Shopping List” and “Plan Meals” actions near the “Low Stock” filter.
   - Ensure the PDF exports have a clean, printable layout.

Please scaffold:
- Data models/entities (InventoryItem, Vendor, Category, Recipe/Meal).
- Endpoints or methods for filtering, listing, and PDF generation.
- UI components/layouts for the new filters, vendor management, and action buttons.
